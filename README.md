The project is aimed to detect 5 basic emotions by facial expression.
1. Happy
2. Sad
3. Surprised
4. Angry
5. Neutral

# Project structure
- app - The Flask Application for Model Presentation
- csv

# How to start Flask?
- Make sure you trained your models, put them in root directory of apps/Emotion Detection App
- Activate you virtual env, or create a new with requirements.txt
- Change directory to flask app root folder: cd "../apps/Emotion Detection App"
- Start the command: python camera_flask_app.py
- Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on your browser
